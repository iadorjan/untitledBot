Hedera 

EVM Innovator track 

🔗 EVM Innovator Track ⸺ $4,000
Hedera’s EVM compatibility allows developers to write Solidity contracts while benefiting from fast finality and low fees. This bounty is about using cross‑chain and real‑world data to build innovative dApps. Example ideas include multi‑chain financing, cross‑chain auctions or data‑driven trading bots.
Qualification Requirements
1. Deploy and verify a smart contract on Hedera — use Hedera mainnet, testnet or previewnet; verify contracts on Hashscan.
2. Integrate oracles and/or bridges — consume external price feeds from Chainlink, Pyth or Supra, and/or use Chainlink CCIP, LayerZero or HashPort for cross‑chain transfers.
3. Use Hedera services where relevant — consider HTS System Contracts or the Token Service for hybrid native/EVM functionality.
4. Deliverables — provide open‑source code, a clear README and a demo video. Bonus points for combining multiple oracles/bridges, integrating Hedera wallet flows (HashPack, Kabila, MetaMask Snap), or offering a novel real‑world use case.

Build dapps on Rootstock and unleash your creativity. We’re looking for original solutions. Some examples include:
🔸DeFi Automation Agents
🔸Smart Contract Assistants
🔸Cross-Chain Interoperability Agents
🔸Decentralized Governance Helpers
Qualification Requirements
Qualification Requirements
- Smart contract deployed in Rootstock and at least 2 on-chain (testnet) successful transactions.
- Projects must have a description and a GitHub repository with a descriptive README.
- The README should include:
1) Clear short one-sentence description of your submission.
2) Short description of what you integrated Rootstock with and how.
3) Short description of the team and their backgrounds.
4) Clear instructions for testing the integration.
5) Feedback describing your experience with building on Rootstock.
6) A short video demo or slide deck.

Hedera stands apart as a leading EVM blockchain through its distinctive developer experience. Developers of all backgrounds can leverage familiar tools like Solidity and EVM libraries or SDKs in JavaScript, Rust, Python and more to build applications. The AI Agent Kit SDK also enables you to build agentic applications easily. The blockchain network is powered by the hashgraph consensus algorithm which enables 10,000+ TPS, 3s finality, low fixed fees priced in USD, and fair ordering (no MEV).
