1) Clear short one-sentence description of your submission:
Our bot aims to integrate the functionalities and APIs available from Rootstock. For example, it can display account balances and provide access within the Discord bot to view transactions or network deployments made by users.

2) Short description of what you integrated Rootstock with and how. 

An example of a visualization query is calling the eth_getBalance method and getting the response by calling RPC_URL= 'https://rpc.mainnet.rootstock.io/gg1EqN38geRB99w7kX1x114dLFMre9-T' defined within the project's .env environment variables

3) Short description of the team and their backgrounds.

We are two members, father and son. Alejandro (father) is a Systems Engineer, with a Master's degree in Computer Science and a PhD candidate, and Ignacio (son) is a student at ORT University Uruguay, where he is finishing his second year of studies.

 4) Clear instructions for testing the integration. 
 
 Once the bot's private variables are configured, both in the .env file and the Discord TOKEN, and the configurations and variables specified in .env.example, the bot is run with npm install, npm run run (which compiles to TypeScript and then runs the server).
 
 5) Feedback describing your experience with building on Rootstock. 
 
 The experience was incredibly interesting, allowing us to integrate the functionalities, create accounts, integrate faucets, view them in the browser, and more. The available documentation guidelines are very clear.

 6) A short video demo or slide deck.
